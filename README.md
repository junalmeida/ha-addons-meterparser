# Home Assistant - Meter Parser AddOn
[![BuyMeCoffee][buymecoffeebadge]][buymecoffee] ![Checks][checksbadge]
![Last release][releasebadge] [![Hacs][hacsbadge]][hacs] [^1]

This is an addon (not HACS) to allow parse of dial and digits utility meters like water, gas, and electricity to provide energy consumption information to home assistant using a regular ip camera.

This repository is under alpha stage, so expect bugs and breaking changes.

### Highlights of what **Meter Parser** can do

* Parse Meters
* Provide a consumption sensor of `total_increasing` state type.
* Cheap IP or PoE cameras must do

### Potential Downsides

* Positioning a camera and getting a good image could be difficult.
* Could be hard to setup calibration parameters.
* To recognize digits, this project relys on OCR services on the internet. I am open to 
suggestions on better local libraries to scan digits. Recognizing dials is simple and local,
no internet connection or APIs are required.

## Installation through Supervisor

1. Add [https://github.com/junalmeida/homeassistant-addons](https://github.com/junalmeida/homeassistant-addons) as a custom
   repository on supervisor repositories.
2. Click install under "Meter Parser" in the Add-on Store
3. If you have native MQTT enabled, supervisor may provide configuration. Otherwise, setup mqtt server, user and password.
3. Setup the meter camera and start the add-on
4. Start the add-on


## Usage

* Entities will show up as `sensor.<friendly name>`, for example (`sensor.water_meter`).
```yaml
# Add-on configuration example
